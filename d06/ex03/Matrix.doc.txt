<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------

In mathematics, a matrix (plural: matrices) is a rectangular array of numbers,
symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns.
A matrix with the same number of rows and columns, sometimes used to represent
a linear transformation from a vector space to itself, such as reflection, rotation, or shearing

Your Matrix Class has seven Class constants: IDENTITY, SCALE, RX, RY, RZ,
TRANSLATION and PROJECTION.
The Class’ constructor is waiting for an array. The following keys are required:
’preset’: the matrix type to, mandatory. The value must be one of the Class
constants previoulsy defined.
’scale’: the scale factor, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth SCALE.
’angle’: the rotation angle in radians, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth RX, RY
or RZ.
’vtc’: translation vector, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth TRANSLATION.
’fov’: projection field of view in degrees mandatory when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.
’ratio’: projected image ratio, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.
’near’: projection’s near clipping plane mandatory when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.
’far’: projection’s far clipping plane mandatory when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.

Matrix Class has the following public methods:

-mult( Matrix $rhs )
returns the multiplication of both matrices.

-transformVertex( Vertex $vtx )
returns a new vertex resulting from the transformation of the vertex by the matrix.
